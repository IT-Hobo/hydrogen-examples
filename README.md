# **Hydrogen Examples**

This repository contains examples and references of Hydrogen implementations. Hydrogen is a **React-based framework** for building dynamic, **Shopify-powered** [custom storefronts](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts).

In each directory you will find a self-contained example application that demonstrates using Hydrogen. These examples are built and maintained by partners and community members.

See the `README.md` in each example directory for more details on how to get started for each project.

To explore Hydrogen, you can get started locally using [yarn or npm](https://shopify.dev/beta/hydrogen/getting-started) or explore a preview experience of Hydrogen on Stackblitz at [hydrogen.new](hydrogen.new)
